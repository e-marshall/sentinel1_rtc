# To do

ch1, ch2 landing pages
- link to notebooks

mf_dataset notebook
- list xarray methods used in learning goals section
- clean up xarray attr-based labeling in plotting
- include more background

vrt
- list xarray methods used in learning goals section
- move read in vector data cell
- getting error trying to use `rio.write_nodata()` to convert nodata value from 0. to nan
        "AttributeError: 'RasterDataset' object has no attribute 'write_nodata'" <-- version issue?

pc
- list xarray methods used in learning goals section
- there's some narrative text that's redundant with an earlier notebook - better to keep in so that notebooks are more self-contained or take out to be more concise?
    - thinking spec of the power scale to dB explanation and power_to_db() function
    
comparison 
- clean up functions , add to s1_tools.py
- maybe take out the section digging more into individual time steps, duplicates and missing data
- more discussion comparing the two
    different inputs (GRD, SLC)
    different DEMs
    different spatial resolutions
