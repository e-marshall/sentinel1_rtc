# Summary

This tutorial demonstrates accessing and working with various publicly available Sentinel-1 Radiometric Terrain Corrected imagery datasets using xarray and other open-source python software packages. It contains examples of how to work with large volumes of cloud-processsed imagery locally, as well as accessing and working with cloud-optimized data types hosted and accessed from a cloud-based data catalog. A large portion of this tutorial was focused on making sure that appropriate metadata is carried through processing steps and organized in an easy-to-work with way to prepare analysis-ready data. The tutorial also demonstrates preliminary dataset comparisons through visualizations and the beginnings of an exploratory data analysis workflow. Hopefully, you got an idea of how to leverage **[xarray](https://xarray.dev/)** functionality at various steps of a typical remote sensing data analysis workflow. 

I'm very open to feedback on this project as it is still a work in progress and I'm always learning how to better work with these tools and datasets. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions please don't hesitate to raise an issue or reach out to me directly. Thanks for stopping by!
