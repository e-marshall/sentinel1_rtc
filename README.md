A jupyter book tutorial demonstrating accessing and working with Sentinel-1 RTC imagery using xarray. 
This tutorial demonstrates accessing and working with two datasets of Sentinel-1 RTC imagery: 
1) A time series processed by Alaska Satellite Facility's On-Demand Processing Server and downloaded locally as geotiffs and 
2) A dataset processed and made available as cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs by Microsoft Planetary Computer.

This tutorial contains notebooks related to data access, organizing and handling metadata, data inspection, comparing datasets, and exploratory analysis and visualization, all with a focus on demonstrating xarray functionality for remote sensing data workflows.
